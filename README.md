#  Sign Language Translator ðŸ¤Ÿ

This desktop software uses real-time technology to detect hand signs which then converts into spoken words and translations across different  languages. The application combines Python programming with OpenCV along with fundamental machine learning model structures.

This project was developed by a team of four:

1)Anderson Abraham

2)Alfred Santhosh

3)Franklin V Jose

4)K.Rohit

## ðŸ”§ Features

-  Webcams enable immediate hand gesture detection functionality

-  The system transforms detected signs first into text and then into speech output

-  The system enables translation of detected words into several different languages

-  Lightweight ML-based gesture classifier

-  The system functions without internet connection and with internet connectivity

-  IP Camera reconfiguration support

##  How It Works

1. Use collect_imgs.py to gather training data for each gesture

2. Run create_dataset.py to process and label data

3. Train a model with train_classifier.py

4. Launch the translator app using inference_classifier.py
